excerpt: Japan, the Land of the Rising Sun. It's not often that you do an internship for a position outside of Canada or the US. This past summer though, I was given the opportunity to work for one of Japan's biggest tech companies for a position in Tokyo. And what an experience it was.

Hey everyone!

In this post, I will be going through my internship experience, providing insight and tips for students that are interested in Mercari or working in Japan in general! A quick summary of my position: I was a frontend developer on one of the several teams (or camps as we would call it) working on the main Mercari app; a C2C (customer to customer) application that allows anyone to buy and/or sell goods to anyone across Japan.

**Disclaimer:** Due to privacy and security concerns, I will not go into too much details on what I've worked on specifically but rather describing the culture and life on what it's like to work for Mercari as well as my experience of working from the other side of the globe.
